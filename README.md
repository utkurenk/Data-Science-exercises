# Data Science Exercises

Welcome to my **Data Science Exercises** repository! ðŸš€  
This is where I document my journey as I learn and practice Data Science.  

## About  
I am just getting started with Data Science and am excited to explore the world of data, analysis, and machine learning. This repository contains exercises, notes, and projects that I work on while learning the fundamentals of Data Science.  

## Topics Covered  
- Python Basics for Data Science  
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Visualization with Libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn  
- Introduction to Machine Learning (Coming Soon)  

## Tools and Libraries  
Here are some of the tools and libraries I use:  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

## How to Use  
Feel free to explore the repository! If youâ€™re learning Data Science too, these exercises might be helpful. You can clone this repository and run the notebooks on your local machine.
